Core Python 
-----------
Python - Data Structures - Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples, set

Functions - call a function, pass args to functions, variable length argument (*args, **kwargs)
            pass by value, pass by reference, scope of a variable (local, global, non local), lambdas, 
	    closures, higher order functions, decorator

class 	  - class,

File Handling
-------------
ascii format

Open a file in different modes - read, write, append

open the file in read mode
--------------------------
if the file does not exists (mis-spelt) - raises and exception - FileNotFound

if the file exists then it opens the file in read mode (we can only read the contents of the file) and read mode is the default mode.

open the file in write mode
---------------------------
if the file exists then it will delete the contents of the file and starts adding the data newly into the file

if the file does not exits then creates a new file with the name specified and adds the data into the file

open the file in append mode
----------------------------
if the file already exists then opens the file and appends the data into the file without disturbing the old contents

if the file does not exits then creates a new file with the name specified and adds the data into the file

csv file is the same as text file (Same format ascii), comma separated values

Excel - openpyxl

seek
----
seek(offset, whence)

offset - no of bytes
whence - 0  - BOF
	 1  - Current Position
	 2  - EOF

seek(350, 0)
seek(-185, 1)
seek(225, 1)
seek(-400, 2)
seek(-10, 0)

From emp.csv read the data and extract the following details

1. count of male(m) and females(f)
2. distinct list of departments
3. distinct list of designations
4. sum of all salaries

5. sum of all female HR salaries

[ws.cell(row=i, column=source_col).value for i in range(1, ws.max_row)]


Pandas
------
Pandas was created by Wes McKinney 2008

pandas is basically used to extract data from the source -> cleansing -> load

List- 
     		 one dimension
indexing   -  	integer based	
data types - 	heterogenous
performance - 	small tasks
functionality - basic iteration, slicing
missing data  - None, "NA"

Pandas - 
      series(1D), DataFrame(2D)
indexing   -	labeled, hierarchical or int based
data types - 	column wise consistent type
performance - 	large scale data
functionality - builtin methods for filtering, grouping, merging reshaping
missing data  - isna(), fillna(), dropna()
